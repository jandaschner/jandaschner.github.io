3. Which Data I Collect And Process

3.1 In General

I process personal data that you as a user of the App make available to me, for example by using my App.

When using my App, you have the option of transmitting health and movement data (namely duration, distance, weight, weights and reps, exercises, calories, protein, fat and carbohydrates, recipes and your goals) by manual input in my app, which are stored on your mobile device. No data is imported from "Apple Health" or similar services/applications.


3.3 Service Use

Google Analytics

This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google. Google Analytics uses cookies. I use Google Analytics to analyze and constantly improve the use of my App. 

Google Analytics for Mobile

General. For Apps on iOS I use Google’s Google Analytics for Mobile (for more information see here). User data is transmitted in an anonymized form to Google. My App uses identification for mobile devices, including the Google Advertising ID (“GAID”) and the ID for Advertising for iOS (“IDFA”), as well as technologies similar to cookies for the use execution of the Analytics for mobile service.

Purpose. I use Google Analytics to analyze and constantly improve the use of my App. Through the statistics I am able to improve the App for the benefit of the users. In those special cases in which personal data is transmitted to the USA, Google is certified via EU-US privacy shield. The basis for the processing of Data are our legitimate interests.


3.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies

Cookies

What Are Cookies. The Website uses “cookies” – small text files that are placed on your computer, mobile device and/or stored by the browser. The basis for the processing of Data via cookies are our legitimate interests.


Plug-Ins

The VisualHype Products include social media plug-ins, such as (i) Facebook; (ii) Google +, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043; (iii) Twitter, 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA; and (iv) WhatsApp, WhatsApp Inc., 650 Castro Street, Suite 120-219, Mountain View, CA 94041, USA.

Such plug-ins can recognize a user’s IP address and the page visited on the visualhype.net platform and, possibly, store cookies, so that the services offered by VisualHype work properly. Some Apps may use functions of third parties (e.g. Facebook) through the third party’s SDK (Software Development Kit), which may process general device data (e.g. device ID, etc.). Social media plug-ins and widgets are hosted either by third-party providers or directly by us. Your interactions with these plugins are subject to this Privacy Policy or the privacy policy of any third party that offers such feature. The basis for the processing of Data via plug-ins are our legitimate interests.

VISUALHYPE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF, OR GUIDELINES REGARDING THE USE OF, PERSONAL DATA BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS.

Users may recognize the respective plug-ins of third parties, e.g. by the respective logo or other characteristics typical for the respective social media platform on our Website. You can find an overview of Facebook plug-ins here. You can find an overview of Google+ plug-ins here. You can find an overview of Twitter plug-ins here.

If a user interacts with the plug-ins, e.g. by clicking on the Facebook “Like” button or entering a comment, while being logged in to said user’s Social Media account on Facebook, Google+, or Twitter, a user links the contents of the VisualHype Website to his/her respective social media profile. Thereby, Facebook/Google+/Twitter can associate a user’s visit or use of the Products with said user’s social media account. VisualHype, as the provider of the Products, does not have any knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its usage by Facebook, Google+, or Twitter. Users can find more information on the issue of data transmission in the privacy policy of the respective social media platform:

Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
